# Stacks & Queues

## Stacks (LIFO)

- Think of a stack of plates, disks, etc.
- Last In, First Out (LIFO)
- Inserting an element on top of the stack is called **push** and removing an element from the top of the stack is called **pop**, both are $O(1)$ time complexity
- **Peek** is looking at the top element of the stack without removing it, $O(1)$ time complexity
- **isEmpty** checks if the stack is empty, $O(1)$ time complexity
- **size** returns the number of elements in the stack, $O(1)$ time complexity

## Queues (FIFO)

- Think of a line of people waiting for something
- First In, First Out (FIFO)
- Inserting an element at the end of the queue is called **enqueue** and removing an element from the front of the queue is called **dequeue**, both are $O(1)$ time complexity
- You can implement a queue using a linked list or an array
